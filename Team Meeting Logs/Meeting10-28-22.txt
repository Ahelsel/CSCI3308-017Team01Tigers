 In the first meeting (during lab session), we decided on the project topic (Grocery List) as well as:
 1. Created a Github Repository
 2. Created a Github Project Board
 3. Created a Use Case Diagram
 4. Created a Google Doc outlinined our Project/Plan
 5. Created a Wireframe showcasing what our Grocery List might look like
 
 We also decided on future meeting time, when we will meet with our TA, and also how we will communicate with each other (Discord).
